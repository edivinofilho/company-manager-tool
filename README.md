# Business Information Management Application

## Description
The Business Information Management Application is designed to assist business owners and their employees in finding relevant information based on their access levels. The web interface consumes an API to display the information on the screen with a focus on aesthetics while prioritizing functionality and a seamless user experience. The main challenge of this project was to simulate a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an HR management application with two types of users: the common user (employee) with limited access to functionalities, and the administrator user responsible for managing the entire application. The application is tasked with identifying each user and determining their permissions.

## Features
- Web interface to consume the API and display information
- Two types of users: common user (employee) and administrator
- Limited access to functionalities for common users
- Complete access to manage the application for administrators
